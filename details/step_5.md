[Return to Main Menu](../README.md#index)

WARNING: Please use Chef Client version 16.2 in order to successful run this POC repo with Audit Cookbook and policies (download links have been updated below)
  
#### 5.1 Windows Manual Bootstrap
  
  
Install the Chef Client on the Windows VM.  Here is the link - https://downloads.chef.io/tools/infra-client/stable?v=16.2.73&os=windows
  
  
Copy the Org Validator `.pem` file that was created when you configured the Chef Server.  Copy the pem file to:  
```c:\chef\```
  
  
Create a `client.rb` file in the `c:\chef\` directory with the following:  
```ruby
chef_server_url 'https://YOUR_CHEF_AUTOMATE/organizations/YOUR_ORG'
validation_key 'C:/chef/YOUR_ORG_validator.pem'
node_name 'Win2016-Ant-24223'
policy_group 'development'
policy_name 'base'
ssl_verify_mode :verify_none
chef_license 'accept'
```
  
For waivers, create a file called `c:\waiver.yml` and add the following:
```yaml

This waiver file will be picked up by the `audit_agr` cookbook and applied.
  
Now run the following command from a Windows PowerShell terminal running as `Administrator`:  
```bash
chef-client
```
  
  
You should now see your node in Chef Automate under the `Infrastructure` tab:
![windows](/images/windows.png "Windows")
  
  
#### 5.2 Linux Manual Bootstrap
  
  
Install the Chef Client on the Linux VM.  Here are the download links:  
- Amazon Linux : https://downloads.chef.io/tools/infra-client/stable?v=16.2.73&os=amazon
- Debian : https://downloads.chef.io/tools/infra-client/stable?v=16.2.73&os=debian
- Ubuntu : https://downloads.chef.io/tools/infra-client/stable?v=16.2.73&os=ubuntu
- RHEL / CentOS : https://downloads.chef.io/tools/infra-client/stable?v=16.2.73&os=el
  
Copy the Org Validator `.pem` file that was created when you configured the Chef Server.  Copy the pem file to:  
```/etc/chef```
  
  
Create some directories that are needed:  
```bash
/bin/mkdir -p /etc/chef
/bin/mkdir -p /var/lib/chef
/bin/mkdir -p /var/log/chef
```
  
  
Create a `client.rb` file in the `/etc/chef/` directory with the following:  
```ruby
log_location     STDOUT
chef_server_url 'https://YOUR_CHEF_AUTOMATE/organizations/YOUR_ORG'
validation_key '/etc/chef/YOUR_ORG_validator.pem'
node_name 'CentOS-Reesy-nNGX'
ssl_verify_mode :verify_none
policy_group 'development'
policy_name 'base'
chef_license 'accept'
```
  
For waivers, create a file called `/home/centos/waiver.yml` and add the following:

#### 5.3. Knife bootstrap off the Chef Workstation (Needs Port 22)
  
This command runs on the Chef Workstation 
  
```bash
knife bootstrap $node_dns \
                --node-name $node_name \
                --connection-user $user \
                --ssh-identity-file $creds_file \
                --policy-name $policy_name \
                --policy-group $policy_group \
                --connection-port $node_port \
                --ssh-verify-host-key=never \
                --chef-license=accept \
                --sudo \
                -y
```
  
  
#### 5.4 Knife bootstrap commands
  
AWS Centos knife bootstrap.  
```bash
knife bootstrap -i ~\.ssh\id_rsa centos@ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -N Your_Node_Name --sudo -run-list 'recipe[Your_Cookbook_Name]'
```
  
  
AWS RHEL knife bootstrap.  
```bash
knife bootstrap -i Path_to_Identity_file  ec2-user@ec2-XX-XXX-XXX-XXX.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com -N Your_Node_Name --sudo -run-list 'recipe[Your_Cookbook_Name]'
```
  
  
AWS Windows knife bootstrap.  
```bash
##To bootstrap the node, replace the node IP, Password and Node Name and run the following command

knife bootstrap windows winrm ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com --winrm-user Administrator --winrm-password 'PASSWORD' --node-name Your_Node_Name
```
  
#### 5.4 Automated Bulk Bootstrap
  
Bootstrapping the chef-client on many nodes in bulk can present a challenge. Using the traditional bootstrapping tools included with the ChefDK (knife bootstrap) to install and register the chef-client on a bulk number (hundreds or thousands) of nodes will result in exhausting resources on the bastion host before your operations are complete, including CPU, memory, and TCP connections.
